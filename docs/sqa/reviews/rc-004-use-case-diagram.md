## Checklist Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Actors are defined with correct UML stereotypes (e.g. `<<System>>`, `<<Actor>>`) | Pass | Actor table gives `<<Actor>>` and the diagram boundary carries `<<System>>`. |
| 2 | System boundary is clearly drawn and labeled | Pass | The boundary `Flash Card` is drawn and labelled. |
| 3 | Include/extend relationships are used correctly per UML 2.5.1, not as generic "uses" arrows | Pass | No include or extend is used; the table of Relationships says none, and why. |
| 4 | Every actor participates in at least one use case (no orphan actors) | Pass | The only actor, Learner, takes part in Study Flash Cards. |
| 5 | Diagram is traceable to a documented stakeholder need | Pass | The actor traces to S01 and S02 in the Actor Table. |
| 6 | Use case names are verb phrases describing actor goals, not internal system operations | Pass | `Study Flash Cards` is a verb phrase and an actor goal. |
| 7 | Diagram is free of implementation detail (e.g. UI widgets, database tables) | Pass | No widget, file or table appears in the diagram. |
| 8 | Actor and use case naming is consistent with corresponding Use Case and User Story documents | Pass | Names match UC-001 and US-001 (`Learner`, `Study Flash Cards`). |

## Language and Domain Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The Metadata table has a `Language` row and a `Domain` row, and neither is a placeholder | Pass | Metadata of UCD-001 has `Language | en` and `Domain | it`; neither is a placeholder. |
| 2 | `Language` is a BCP 47 code and `Domain` is a value from the registry's domain list | Pass | `en` is a BCP 47 code and `it` is a value of the registry's domain list. |
| 3 | The content (prose and table cells) is written in the stated language | Pass | Prose and table cells are English; Malay and Danish words and file names appear only as quoted data. |
| 4 | The register matches the one the registry gives for the artifact type | Pass | The registry gives `IT Professional English` for this type; the text is written for that reader. |
| 5 | Domain terms are the PO terms of the domain's dictionary, with no synonyms | Pass | The PO terms of DICT-001 (flash card, word list, words to learn, study session) are used and no synonym replaces them. |
| 6 | Metadata keys, section headings, IDs and statuses are in English | Pass | Metadata keys, headings, IDs and statuses are English. |
| 7 | No translated twin (`<name>.<language>.md`) exists beside the document | Pass | No translated twin exists beside the document (checked in `docs/`). |
| 8 | A change of language or domain since the previous accepted version has a Version History row and was reviewed again | Pass | First version; no change of language or domain since an earlier accepted version. |
| 9 | A reviewer competent in the domain, and in the language, has confirmed that the domain terms are used correctly | Pass | The reviewer is the stand-in for S01, the Product Owner, who reads English and knows the IT domain; no second language reviewer is needed (review-checklist-process step 2). Open to challenge by S01 in the end-of-run summary. |
| 10 | Abbreviations are spelled out on first use, in the stated language | Fail | CSV, MVVM, UI, PO and similar abbreviations are not all spelled out at first use; Optional, deferred. |

## Overall Verdict

Go — every Mandatory criterion passes; the failed Optional criteria are deferred with an action item. Reviewed by AI as stand-in for S01; not independent of the author.

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Due |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Criterion LANG 10 (Optional) failed: Abbreviations are spelled out on first use, in the stated language; fix or accept the deferral | S01 | 2026-10-21 |
